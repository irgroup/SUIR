# Context-Driven Interactive Query Simulations Based on Generative Large Language Models
This repository accompanies our ECIR'24 full paper entitled _"Context-Driven Interactive Query Simulations Based on Generative Large Language Models"_. It contains the code and results to make the experiments transparent and reproducible. All of the experiments can be reproduced with the help of the source code and the Jupyter notebooks. Besides, we also provide the generated resources like queries or simulated interaction logs in the subdirectories.
