McConnell declined, saying he simply could not trust Reid, according to the Senate Republican, who asked for anonymity to speak about the relationship.\\n\\nBut in some way the Reid-McConnell clash is a symptom of other changes in the Senate.\\nThe giants of the Senate\\nIn the past five years, through death and retirement, the Senate has lost a clutch of legends, powerful voices whose decades of service gave them enough influence to rival that of the leaders.\\nJohn W. Warner (R-Va.), Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.) and Ted Stevens (R-Alaska). These were Senate barons who could roll their own leadership when it was required to make a deal. Warner retired in 2008.

At this stage of 2011, the Senate had held only 106 roll-call votes; this year, 171. Yet some basics, such as the budget resolution, have ground to a procedural halt.\\n“The notion that we can’t work together on anything, I’m not finding that to be true,” Kaine said. “But I’m also finding things that ought to be simple are hard. It’s like parallel universes. I’m trying to understand how an institution can be both.”\\nDuring his 24 years in the Senate, Bond remembers strong cross-party alliances that ended up with bills that got huge bipartisan majorities when they came to the floor.\\n“Those were the good ol’ days,” Bond said.\\nNo punching, at least\\nNostalgia for the more genteel Senate is a favorite pastime of senators and other close observers of the body.\\n\\nDodd mocked the idea that the chamber is “too partisan,” noting that the Senate’s heyday in the 19th century — when legends such as Henry Clay, John Calhoun and Daniel Webster served — included fistfights and the occasional gun duel.\\nDodd said today’s newcomers will rise to the occasion if they get the time and chance to legislate in the Senate. There are 55 senators who have taken office since January 2007, never having experienced a GOP majority. It’s the third large wave of new senators in the past 100 years, the first coming after World War II and the second coming on the heels of the Watergate scandal and the Reagan landslide of 1980.\\nIn his first term, in the early 1980s, Dodd spent several days a week angling for a seat in the crowded, private, senators-only dining room on the Capitol’s first floor, soaking up the wisdom of the likes of Sens. Daniel Patrick Moynihan (D-N.Y.), John Stennis (D-Miss.) and Robert J. Dole (R-Kan.). Those three alone served more than 100 combined years and chaired several of the most powerful committees.\\n“It was my PhD in my first seven, eight years,” said Dodd, who made a habit of showing that dining room to new senators in his last days before retiring. “It was as good an education as could be had in the Senate.”\\nNowadays, that room is dormant. Each party schedules mandatory lunches for its own caucus almost every day the Senate is in session.\\n\\nThere was one occasion recently that recalled the old days. In April, to mark the 40th anniversary of McCain’s release from his long captivity as a prisoner of during Vietnam, Reid hosted a luncheon for McCain.\\n“Nobody can recall the last time there was one,” McCain said of such a bipartisan gathering, “and everybody walked out of that room with goodwill, good feelings.”\\nThere are those who hold on to the possibility that things can improve.\\nAs he considered whether to make a Senate bid, Kaine approached Warner, the venerable Republican first elected in 1978 who served 30 years. From the opposite party, Warner could offer only advice, not an endorsement. He said that the Senate used to be such a wonderful place to be that anyone with even a “2 percent chance to win” should take the chance.\\n“I can’t tell you that so unequivocally now, because so many things have changed and it’s so much more difficult,” he said, according to Kaine’s recounting.\\nBut Warner urged Kaine to run because he believed that the problems were fixable.\\n“It’s not in the water supply,” Warner said. “It’s not sick-building syndrome.
